We need to know the actual status of your site, how search engines read it, and what they understand your site is about.\nWe will run an audit using software like Screaming Frog, AHREF, and custom queries directly from the SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). The process will take a minimum of one week and up to five weeks, depending on the size of your site. We measure the size in relation to how many key pages your site has.\nA key page is one that will affect your ranking. Examples of those are:\nAny page part of your public website structure (about us, contact us, the home page, blog post, service or product pages, etc.) Any image that has been stored as a single page. Pages that are indexed should not be indexed. Pages that are not indexed but that should be indexed. Pages that are blocked by robots.txt files that are affecting your ranking. Commonly, site owners do not know exactly how many pages are in the back end of your website. When we run the first audit, we will have an idea, and we will also help you to prioritize the finding. A website could have thousands of pages, but not more than a hundred are really important content pages.\nOn each important page, we will show the areas of improvement like:\nIndexability Meta Information (Title and Descriptions) H1 and H2 tags Image optimization Site speed URL structure Link structure And much more\u0026hellip; You will end up with a full report and a Google Data Studio dashboard that will help you visualize your data in a way that will help you make much better decisions even beyond the SEO scope.
