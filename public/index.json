According to a recent article by Daniela Sirtori-Cortina and Bloomberg on the Fortune 500 Website, Wendy\u0026rsquo;s is planning to test an AI-powered chatbot to take drive-thru orders. Here is a quick summary of the article with the takeaways.\nThis marks the latest instance of the fast-food chain using cutting-edge technology to improve its customer service, while also coping with labor shortages. The chatbot, powered by Google Cloud\u0026rsquo;s AI software, has the ability to understand speech and answer frequently asked questions. Wendy\u0026rsquo;s is hopeful that automating the process will help reduce miscommunication and mistakes, streamline the ordering process, reduce wait times, and improve accuracy.\nWhile the move towards AI and automation in the fast food industry has been a source of controversy, many experts believe that this technology will help businesses streamline their operations and improve the customer experience. Additionally, the debut of OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s ChatGPT in 2022 has led to a surge in interest in AI chatbots among both investors and the general public. This has prompted a fierce competition among tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft to integrate this new chatbot technology into various industries, including the business world.\nKrishna Gupta, Presto\u0026rsquo;s chairman and interim chief executive officer, recently told Bloomberg Television that he does not believe that in three years, there will be a drive-thru having a human take your orders. With Wendy\u0026rsquo;s now testing its AI-powered chatbot, it seems that the future of the fast food industry is becoming increasingly automated.\n","date":"9 May 2023","permalink":"/news/ai-taking-over-drive-thru-wendys/","section":"News","summary":"Skynet may become real after all\u0026hellip; Is the Era of Human Drive-Thru Attendants Coming to an End?","title":"AI is taking over drive-thrus, and Wendys is the latest to jump in the game.

Getting the best resources I can find online and summarizing them here.\nDigital marketing has become a vital component of any business looking to grow its online presence and drive more traffic to its website. Among the various tactics that make up digital marketing, content marketing, email marketing, and search engine optimization (SEO) are three pillars that can help businesses generate leads, build brand awareness, and ultimately increase revenue. I said revenue because, ultimately profits are up to you and your business model.\nContent Marketing # Content marketing involves creating and distributing valuable and relevant content that attracts and retains a target audience, with the goal of driving profitable customer action. This can take many forms, such as blog posts, photos, videos, infographics, whitepapers, and more. The key is to create good quality, unique, informative, engaging, and helpful content for your audience.\nOne of the main benefits of content marketing is that it can help improve your website\u0026rsquo;s SEO. Search engines(like Google) tend to award engaging content pages on their top search results. By creating high-quality content that incorporates relevant keywords, you can improve your website\u0026rsquo;s search engine rankings and attract more organic traffic. In addition, content marketing can help you build credibility and trust with your audience, establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry, and ultimately drive more conversions.\nEmail Marketing # Pro Tip! Start Collecting Emails Now! Most services on the internet rely on the good old Email as a sign-up or log-in mechanism. Email is not going away anytime soon, and when you can have an email list, you are future-proofing your company. No matter what social media or new platform you go to, your emails go with you, and so it can follow your audience.\nEmail marketing involves sending promotional emails to a list of subscribers with the goal of building relationships and driving sales. Email marketing can take many forms, such as newsletters, promotional emails, and drip campaigns(a series of automatic emails based on customer behavior). The key is to create emails that are personalized, relevant, and valuable to your subscribers.\nOne of the main benefits of email marketing is that it can help you build a loyal customer base. By sending regular emails that provide value to your subscribers, you can build trust and loyalty with them over time. In addition, email marketing can help you drive sales by promoting your products or services directly to your subscribers.\nSEO # Pro Tip! More than 75% of people never pass the first page of Google! Do you? SEO involves optimizing your website and its content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This can involve various tactics, such as keyword research, on-page optimization, link building, and more. The goal of SEO is to improve your website\u0026rsquo;s visibility and attract more organic traffic.\nOne of the main benefits of SEO is that it can drive highly targeted traffic to your website. By optimizing your website and its content for relevant keywords, you can attract visitors who are actively searching for products or services like yours. In addition, SEO can help you build credibility and authority in your industry, as well as improve your website\u0026rsquo;s overall user experience.\nConclusion # Content marketing, email marketing, and SEO are three pillars of digital marketing that can help businesses attract and retain customers, build brand awareness, and ultimately increase revenue.
