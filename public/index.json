[{"content":" A Golden Opportunity Beckons Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to follow me on Twitter. The original article is focused on the United States of America, but this is a general truth for most nations; we are in a shortage of interest in keeping up the infrastructures of the present and are more interested in developing the future.\nGecko Robotics, co-founded by Jake Loosararian has focused on just that.\nI invite my fellow entrepreneurs and business leaders to see the hundreds of thousands of miles of highways, railroad tracks, and powerlines, the thousands of dams, airports, bridges, power plants, and chemical plants, and hundreds of ports, refineries, and nuclear facilities as an opportunity to build world-changing products for today and beyond. Come get some dirt (or rust) on your boots. It\u0026rsquo;s good for our world, and yes, good for your bottom line too. Jake Loosararian, co-founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics\nWhat\u0026#39;s the best tool in the toolbox for inspecting large equipment? Rapid Ultrasonic Gridding, aka RUG, has unrivaled productivity and data density to keep your power boilers, tanks, and pressure vessels running optimally and reliably.#geckorobotics #corrosionmonitoring #safety pic.twitter.com/Yzk9ELBDcb\n\u0026mdash; Gecko Robotics (@geckorobotics) May 4, 2023 Our infrastructures are crumbling. Our roads, bridges, water systems, and other critical systems are in desperate need of repair. The cost of inaction is simply too high. But while there is a lot of talk about the future of infrastructure, there is not enough action being taken to address the current crisis. We need to focus on fixing our existing infrastructure before we can start thinking about building new infrastructure.\nThis is not a problem that can be solved by wishful thinking or pie-in-the-sky ideas. It is a problem that requires real solutions from real people. We need a new generation of realists who are willing to make the tough decisions necessary to fix current infrastructure. These realists will need to be willing to make drastic changes and make difficult trade-offs in order to get the job done. They will also need to be willing to challenge the status quo and think outside the box.\nThe future of the world\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure depends on these realists. They are the only ones who can save us from our current crisis.\nHere is a summary of the article \u0026ldquo;America Has an Overabundance of Futurists, but Only Realists Can Save America\u0026rsquo;s Crumbling Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; by Jake Loosararian on Fortune Website:\nAmericans are captivated by the dazzling tech of tomorrow, yet we\u0026rsquo;re overlooking today\u0026rsquo;s immediate problems, notably our crumbling infrastructure. Our obsession with the future might cost us the present.\nOur infrastructure is alarmingly deteriorating. Power plants, bridges, roads, and other physical structures are failing rapidly. The cost of this neglect isn\u0026rsquo;t just financial - it\u0026rsquo;s human lives too.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re missing a significant opportunity right in front of us: our aging built world. The scale of the problems at hand is immense. For instance, the corrosion of physical assets costs globally $2.5 trillion. The cost of power outages in the U.S. is $150 billion per year. There\u0026rsquo;s a gold mine of opportunities waiting to be unearthed, yet we\u0026rsquo;re failing to see it.\nWhile tech innovators are focused on crafting futuristic solutions, my co-founder and I are focusing on today\u0026rsquo;s challenges. We chose to address a current issue: improving power plant safety. As entrepreneurs, we must balance our dreams of tomorrow with the needs of today.\nThe U.S. infrastructure includes 600,000 bridges, 25,000 power plants, and hundreds of thousands of miles of roads, railroads, and powerlines. The task of understanding and maintaining these assets requires vast amounts of data.\nCurrent technologies such as advanced robotics, sensors, and AI can help us gather and analyze this massive data efficiently. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer a sci-fi dream; it\u0026rsquo;s a practical, urgent reality.\nThe technology is there, but we\u0026rsquo;re lacking the vision to apply it to our built world. We need to shift our focus from the distant future to the pressing problems of today\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure.\nFuturists are essential, but so are realists. We need a collaborative approach to solve the immediate issues of our infrastructure using innovative technology. The cost of failing to act could be disastrous.\nSubscribe now for more articles like this. You\u0026rsquo;ll get fresh ideas and practical advice you can use, in less than 3 minutes.
