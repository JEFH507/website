Keyword Research Service
{{< /lead >}}

We do in-depth keyword research that will help us to optimize your content in the next phase. The heart of this research is based on what search engines are currently rewarding and what similar strategies new brands use that work for them.

We look for new brands because older established brands already have a good backlink reputation and authority that you likely don't have yet. So this is a great opportunity to understand how the algorithm rewards new content vs. established one.

This will include a .csv file with:
* List of long-tail keywords
* Parent topic
* Keyword difficulty
* Monthly searches volume
* List of competitors and what pages, keywords, and type of content they are ranking for.
