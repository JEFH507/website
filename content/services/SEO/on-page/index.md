On-Page optimization is the actual implementation of all the areas of improvement in an SEO audit and is fueled by keyword research and competitor analysis. This phase can take months, depending on your site size and how many essential pages we need to optimize.
 
We optimize your on-page content and the technical SEO, such as Robot.txt files and Site maps, to ensure search engines are crawling the correct information of your site.

The main areas to be optimized on each page are:

* Indexability
* Meta Information (Title and Descriptions)
* H1 and H2 tags
* Image optimization
* Site speed
* URL structure
* Link structure
* Rotbot.txt
* Site map
* Content on page
