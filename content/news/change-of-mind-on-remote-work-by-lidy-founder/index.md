The ongoing remote work debate continues as labor forces and employees find themselves torn between returning to physical offices or embracing the comfort of working from home. This week, Lindy's founder sent a memo expressing a change of heart, urging employees to return to the office. I resonate with this shift, as it represents the way forward. While remote work has its benefits for employees, it often falls short in driving innovation and maximizing the bottom line. It tends to create separation rather than fostering cooperation.

While there is room for fully remote companies and hybrid models, they should be seen as exceptions rather than the norm. The feasibility of remote work varies across job positions, with some suitable for remote setups and others not. As inherently social beings, our growth and challenges often emerge from personal interactions.

To forge ahead, I envision a future where companies strike a balance between remote work and in-person collaboration. By embracing both strategies, we can leverage the advantages of flexibility while reaping the benefits of face-to-face interactions. This approach enables innovation and cultivates strong teamwork.

As the remote work landscape evolves, we must recognize the inherent value of human connection and interpersonal dynamics. By finding the right balance, we can navigate the complexities of the modern work environment and build thriving organizations that embrace the best of both worlds.

Here are the main key takeaways from [Flo Crivello](https://flocrivello.com/changing-my-mind-on-remote-about-being-in-san-francisco/), founder of [Lindy](https://www.lindy.ai/):
Key Points:

1. Remote work offers lifestyle benefits, including saving on commute, having a personal office, location flexibility, and schedule adaptability, particularly advantageous for those with families.
2. However, remote work poses challenges for startups aiming to succeed or find product-market fit, especially when developing something innovative.
3. Remote work raises coordination costs:
   - Difficulty in timely communication and delayed interactions due to asynchronous work schedules.
   - Asynchronous interactions lead to lower bandwidth, increased context switching, and more tasks falling through the cracks.
   - Synchronous chats also suffer from limitations, such as the inability to interrupt or have side conversations, and technical issues with video, audio, and screensharing.
4. Remote work hampers alignment within the team, causing individuals to feel out of the loop on project assignments and hindering the development of shared mental models.
5. Colocation offers additional benefits, including enjoyable team interactions, shared meals, after-work socializing, and trust-building activities, all of which contribute to improved teamwork and direct feedback.
6. Colocated teams are often perceived as more formidable competitors compared to remote or hybrid teams.
7. The misalignment resulting from remote work is particularly impactful in the tech industry, where the majority of the work is intangible and relies on shared mental models for high-quality output.
8. The importance of physical proximity and human connections in fostering collaboration, trust, and alignment should be acknowledged and considered when weighing the advantages and limitations of remote work.
