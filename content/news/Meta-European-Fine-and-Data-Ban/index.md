This is a report/summary of the article ["As Meta is hit with EU data ban and $1.3 billion fine, what happens next?"](https://fortune.com/2023/05/22/as-meta-is-hit-with-eu-data-ban-and-1-3-billion-fine-what-happens-next/) by David Mayer on [Fortune 500](https://fortune.com/).

In a landmark decision, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has been hit with a $1.3 billion fine by the Irish privacy watchdog and given a five-month ultimatum to halt the transfer of European personal data to the U.S. This unprecedented move could potentially make Facebook and Instagram unavailable in Europe.

The crux of the issue lies in Meta's inability to prevent U.S. intelligence agencies from accessing European users' personal data, thereby violating European privacy rights. As the clock ticks, Meta has four potential paths: a new data-sharing agreement between the EU and U.S., adapting its operations to stop transferring EU data to the U.S., appealing the decision, or pulling out of the EU entirely.

The most likely and desirable outcome for Meta and other U.S. corporations is a new data-sharing pact. However, previous agreements have been struck down by the EU's highest court due to insufficient U.S. surveillance restrictions. The proposed Data Privacy Framework (DPF) is under scrutiny, with the European Parliament and EU's data protection authorities expressing concerns about the U.S.'s vague surveillance safeguards.

Austrian lawyer Max Schrems, who initiated the complaints against Meta, suggests a 'no spy' agreement or a 'federalized' social network model where only necessary data is transferred to the U.S. Meta, however, is resistant to this localized approach, arguing that global services require global connections.

Schrems believes Meta's chances of a successful appeal are slim due to the EU's stance on U.S. surveillance practices. He predicts Meta will eventually adopt a federated model for its social networks, dismissing the company's threat of withdrawal from Europe as "laughable."

The decision has also tarnished the reputation of the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which initially resisted fining Meta. Furthermore, Meta is now required to delete the European personal data it has transferred to its U.S. systems over the years, a task that promises to be challenging given the company's unclear data management practices.
