### Have you ever taken a moment to consider the User Interface of Chat GPT?

Undoubtedly a hit as a product, it may not have any social media sharing features, but it is still a huge social hit. In fact, it's so revolutionary that it has become social in nature. Everyone and their grandmother is talking about it, both on and off social media.

While Chat GPT has certainly benefited from social media sharing, its business model is not reliant on it. When you create something that others find valuable, they will do the hard work of promoting and becoming evangelizers of your products and services.

### A strong online presence

However, a strong online presence is still a must. OpenAI, the company behind Chat GPT, has a robust social media presence, mainly focused on sharing their own content, research, work, and product updates.

But where do people land when others start talking about you? This could be your own website, blog, YouTube channel, or social media. You want to be ready to make them part of your tribe and ideally get them to sign up to give your product a try.

## Finding value while looking to new technological advances

Our purpose as a business is to create something that has value. In the crossroads of new technology breakthroughs and the new world's needs, huge amounts of value can be created. 

To be future-proof, businesses need to look beyond their current success and prepare for upcoming developments that may render them obsolete or offer new opportunities. Staying up-to-date with new technology and cultural trends allows for quick changes that can enable you to ride the waves or even make them.
