Tech Layoffs in 2023: A Comprehensive List
{{< /lead >}}

A summary of the article ["A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs"](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/tech-industry-layoffs/) by Natasha Mascarenhas and Alyssa Stringer, featured in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/):

Do you feel safe working in tech this year? On the surface, it appears as if major tech giants are trying to shrink their payroll. One can't help but wonder to what extent they're striving to achieve greater efficiency, aiming to accomplish more with less.

As an entrepreneur, there's one lesson I've learned: there are no safe havens. Your sense of stability can't hinge solely on a single business venture or paycheck.

This year, 2023, has unveiled a dramatic upswing in layoffs within the tech industry, shaking the foundations for tens of thousands of tech professionals. Leading tech corporations such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Zoom, alongside a myriad of startups spanning sectors from crypto to enterprise SaaS, have all announced sizable workforce cutbacks. The common narrative for these layoffs seems to revolve around macroeconomic conditions and an imperative for financial discipline in the journey towards profitability.

Monitoring the layoffs in the tech arena doesn't just help us gauge the impact on innovation and the pressures businesses are grappling with, but also exposes an unsettling reality: the number of layoffs in 2023 has already eclipsed the total for 2022. The tally for 2023, right through to the close of April, comes in at a staggering 168,243, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. The monthly progression is telling: January bore witness to 84,714 layoffs, February to 36,491, March to 37,109, and April saw 17,926 jobs evaporate.
