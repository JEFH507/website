The European Union (EU) lawmakers' committees have agreed on stricter draft legislation for regulating artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT. The legislation, known as the AI Act, aims to become the world's first comprehensive set of laws governing AI technology, addressing issues such as facial recognition, biometric surveillance, and other AI applications.

### Main Points:

>The European Parliament moves closer to passing new regulations for AI tools, including ChatGPT, after a decisive vote by lawmakers' committees.

>The proposed AI Act is anticipated to become the first comprehensive legislation globally, covering a wide range of AI applications and setting guidelines for their use.

>After two years of negotiations, the bill will proceed to the next stage, involving finalizing the details with the European Commission and member states.

>The legislation classifies AI tools based on their perceived risk level, imposing different obligations on governments and companies using them.

>MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) agreed to ban facial recognition in public spaces, predictive policing tools, and introduce transparency measures for generative AI applications like ChatGPT.

>The vote signals the importance of protecting fundamental rights and ensuring that AI serves people, society, and the environment.

>The bill will undergo a plenary vote in the European Parliament in June, followed by trilogue talks involving representatives from the Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission.

>A grace period of approximately two years will be provided for affected parties to comply with the regulations before the bill becomes law.

>Strong advocacy for protecting the rights of individuals inside and entering the EU is emphasized during the trilogue discussions.
