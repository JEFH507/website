Navigating the world of business can be both exhilarating and challenging, especially when faced with the presence of copycat competitors. As a small business owner, witnessing someone imitate your every move can be frustrating and raise concerns about the future of your enterprise. However, it's essential to approach these situations with a strategic mindset. In this [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-your-small-business-should-handle-copycats-competitors/448949), "How Your Small Business Should Handle Copycats Competitors," written by Chris Ronzio on May 20, 2023, he explores effective strategies and actionable steps that small businesses can take to handle copycat competitors. From understanding the legal aspects to leveraging differentiation and customer focus, we will provide valuable insights on how to thrive in the face of imitation and emerge as a resilient and innovative player in the marketplace.

The article begins by emphasizing the common initial response of frustration upon realizing that someone is copying your business (like what!? Are you for real?). However, it suggests a different perspective, encouraging small business owners to view the situation as a form of flattery instead. The concept is to see the act of copying as a validation of your business's success, indicating that others perceive it as worthy of imitation.

The key points of the article "How Your Small Business Should Handle Copycats Competitors" by Chris Ronzio are as follows:

1. Be flattered and do a legal checklist: Instead of getting frustrated, consider it a form of validation if someone copies your business. Check if any laws are being broken by reviewing your trademarks, copyrights, and trade dress. If necessary, involve an attorney.

2. Evaluate the competence of the copycat: Determine whether the copycat is a low-quality imitation or a legitimate competitor. If the copycat is offering an inferior product or service, it may not be a significant threat.

3. Set yourself apart with a customer-focused strategy: Concentrate on your customers' needs and preferences. By understanding and catering to their desires, you can differentiate your business from competitors. Southwest Airlines is cited as an example of successfully differentiating through a low-cost, efficient approach.

4. Focus on your own growth: Rather than constantly worrying about copycats, concentrate on providing value to your customers. By focusing on your customers and continually improving your business, you can maintain a competitive advantage.

Overall, the article advises small business owners to approach copycats with a positive mindset, assess their legal standing, differentiate themselves through customer-centric strategies, and prioritize their own growth rather than being solely focused on competitors.
Here are two real life cases of big cat fights which show that is not always best to be first but rather to have the ability to adapt and read your audience. 

### Original 1 – Copycat 0
Snapchat maintained its success despite copycat features introduced by Facebook. Its unique disappearing messages and innovative offerings, coupled with a strong brand identity, resonated with users. Snapchat's focus on younger demographics, continuous innovation, and differentiated experiences allowed it to thrive and retain its loyal user base. 

### Original 0 – Copycat 1
TikTok, launched by ByteDance, succeeded by offering a concept similar to Vine. Its short-form videos, algorithmic feed, and global reach attracted a large user base, particularly among younger demographics. Despite being called a copycat, TikTok's execution, innovation, and strategic improvements propelled it to surpass the original and thrive. 

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of focusing on customers and developing a strategy that sets the business apart from copycats. By understanding customer preferences and delivering value, small businesses can stay ahead of the competition and establish themselves as the original and preferred choice in the eyes of their target audience.
