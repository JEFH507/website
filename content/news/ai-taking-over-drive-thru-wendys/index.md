## Is the Era of Human Drive-Thru Attendants Coming to an End?

The fast food industry is experiencing a major transformation. According to a recent article by *Daniela Sirtori-Cortina and Bloomberg* on the Fortune 500 [Website](https://fortune.com/2023/05/09/wendys-ai-powered-chatbot-drive-thru-orders/), Wendy's is planning to test an AI-powered chatbot to take drive-thru orders. Here is a quick summary of the article with the takeaways.

This marks the latest instance of the fast-food chain using cutting-edge technology to improve its customer service, while also coping with labor shortages. The chatbot, powered by Google Cloud's AI software, has the ability to understand speech and answer frequently asked questions. Wendy's is hopeful that automating the process will help reduce miscommunication and mistakes, streamline the ordering process, reduce wait times, and improve accuracy.

While the move towards AI and automation in the fast food industry has been a source of controversy, many experts believe that this technology will help businesses streamline their operations and improve the customer experience. Additionally, the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 has led to a surge in interest in AI chatbots among both investors and the general public. This has prompted a fierce competition among tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft to integrate this new chatbot technology into various industries, including the business world.

>Krishna Gupta, Presto's chairman and interim chief executive officer, recently told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-05-01/ai-s-impact-on-the-restaurant-industry-video) Television that he does not believe that in three years, there will be a drive-thru having a human take your orders. With Wendy's now testing its AI-powered chatbot, it seems that the future of the fast food industry is becoming increasingly automated.
