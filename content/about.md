Welcome to The Shaggy Report *by Javier Feliu.*

This is an independent effort to track the success stories of businesses and creators that have mastered their craft without compromising their integrity or their sanity in a world that is overflowed with content, data, and information. 

After owning a business for many years, and came to realize how much impact a good marketing strategy and implementation can make or break your business. I decided to dive deep into Digital Marketing, focusing on the bottom line for business. If there are no profits, there is no business.

You will also find here resources that I wish I had known before managing my business. If you are a business owner, marketer, or curious mind, then check out some of the insights I share here on how others are able to run their businesses with a marketing approach.

The Shaggy Report is a Digital Marketing effort to reach new audiences without becoming dependent and addicted to social media. This is important because you do not own your own platform, and you should. Social media is a great tool. Make no mistake, you can have tremendous success with it, but if you are part of that small percentage of the population that does not want to surrender their life to an algorithm, then you are my kind of mind.
