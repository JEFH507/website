Welcome to The Shaggy Report,

This is an independent publication that tracks success stories of businesses and creators that have mastered their craft without compromising their integrity or their sanity in a world saturated with content, data, and information. 

After owning several small businesses for many years, we realized how much impact a good administration, marketing strategy, and implementation can make or break your business. We decided to dive deep into Digital Marketing, focusing on the bottom line for business. If there are no profits, there is no business.

You will also find resources I wish I had known before managing our business here. If you are a business owner, marketer, or curious mind, then check out some of the insights we share here on how others are able to run their businesses. We mainly focus on client acquisition, marketing, and big-picture strategy.

One of our goals is to encourage and empower you to succeed on your own terms, not the Big Tech way of doing things. Platforms come and go, but a good business is here to stay for many generations. We want to help you reach new audiences without relying only on social media or other platforms. 

This is important because you do not own your own platform, and you should. Social media is a great tool. Make no mistake, you can have tremendous success with it, but if you are part of that small percentage of the population that does not want to surrender their life to an algorithm, then you are a mind after our own heart.
